## To run the code first check if you have all the libraries in your environment
For example,
- pip install numpy
- pip install pandas
- pip install tensorflow


### How to get the Data Set?:

1.1. **Download the Dataset:**
   - Access the dataset at [Synthetic ASL Alphabet Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lexset/synthetic-asl-alphabet).
   - Click on the "Download" button to obtain the ZIP file containing the dataset.

1.2. **Extract the Files:**
   - After downloading the ZIP file, extract its contents using any file extraction tool (e.g., WinRAR, 7-Zip, or the built-in extraction option in your operating system).
   - Place the extracted files into a folder named `/Data/` on your PC. Ensure the `/Data/` folder is located in the same directory as your script or notebook.

1.3. **Organize the Folder Structure:**
   - Once the files are extracted, arrange the dataset to achieve the following structure:
     - `/Data/Test_Alphabet/`
     - `/Data/Train_Alphabet/`

1.4. **Verify the Structure:**
   - Double-check that the images are correctly placed within their respective folders (`Test_Alphabet` and `Train_Alphabet`).
   - The `/Data/` folder should now contain the subfolders `Test_Alphabet` and `Train_Alphabet`.

1.5. **Run the Code on Your PC:**
   - Ensure all file paths in your script or notebook point to the `/Data/` folder.
